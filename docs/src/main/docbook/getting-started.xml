    <title>Getting Started</title>

    <para>
        This chapter provides a quick introduction on how to get started building
    RESTful services using Jersey. The example described here uses the lightweight
    Grizzly HTTP server. At the end of this chapter you will see how to
    implement equivalent functionality as a JavaEE web application you can deploy
    on any servlet container supporting Servlet 2.5 and higher.
