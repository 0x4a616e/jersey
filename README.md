### Licensing and Governance
Jersey is licensed under a dual license - [CDDL 1.1 and GPL 2.0 with Class-path Exception](http://glassfish.java.net/public/CDDL+GPL_1_1.html). That means you can choose which one of the two suits your needs better and use it under those terms. 

We use [GlassFish Governance Policy](http://glassfish.java.net/public/GovernancePolicy.html), which means we can only accept contributions under the terms of [OCA](http://oracle.com/technetwork/goto/oca).
